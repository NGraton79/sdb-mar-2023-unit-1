      <!-- About me -->
    <h1>Nick Graton</h1>
    <h2>Plattsburgh, New York</h2>
    <p>I joined this cohort because I had started a course in software development last year and didn't finish it. I really enjoyed the learning and the content but was not able to keep up while also working a full-time job. Now that I have the available time I want to give it another go but while doing it full-time so I don't get burnt out again.</p>

    <!-- Two Truths and a lie 
        Bronze:
      - Make an h1 tag saying 'Two Truths and a Lie'
      - Make 3 h3 tags, each saying a short blurb about that option (example: 'Been to Russia')
      - Make 3 p tags (one for each h3 tag), giving a short sentence elaborating that truth/lie
      - Wrap it all in a div tag
